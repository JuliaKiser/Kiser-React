## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Webpage Details

My react portfolio takes the skills gained throughout this course and really puts them to the test. Utilizing the component structure and creating a react app, I was able to customize each component and section of my portfolio.

My portfolio gives you insight into a litle bit about me as a developer, my skills, a few projects that I am particularly proud of, as well as contact information and other resources to learn more about me.
